        "text": "I think the first step is to conduct a comprehensive search of job boards, company websites, and other relevant sources to identify job postings in Austin. I can use a Google search to find job boards and company websites, and then scrape the websites to extract job postings. I should also save the job postings to a file for future reference.",
        "reasoning": "Conducting a comprehensive search of job boards and company websites is the first step in finding relevant job postings in Austin. This will allow me to gather a large amount of data that I can then filter based on the user's preferred industry, job title, and other relevant criteria. Saving the job postings to a file will also allow me to keep track of the data and avoid duplicating my efforts.",
        "plan": "- Use a Google search to find job boards and company websites\n- Scrape the websites to extract job postings\n- Save the job postings to a file for future reference",
        "criticism": "I need to ensure that I am only scraping websites that allow web scraping and that I am not violating any terms of service. I also need to make sure that I am not collecting any personal information that could be used for malicious purposes.",
