        "text": "Now that I have identified job boards and company websites in Austin, I can filter the job postings based on the user's preferred industry, job title, and other relevant criteria. The user has specified that they are looking for software engineering jobs in Texas that require 5 years of experience with React, TypeScript, and Node. I can use regular expressions to filter the job postings based on these criteria.",
        "reasoning": "Filtering the job postings based on the user's preferred industry, job title, and other relevant criteria will allow me to narrow down the data and only show the most relevant opportunities to the user. Using regular expressions to filter the job postings based on specific skills and experience will also ensure that the user is only seeing job postings that match their qualifications.",
        "plan": "- Use regular expressions to filter the job postings based on the user's preferred industry, job title, and other relevant criteria",
        "criticism": "I need to ensure that the regular expressions are accurate and that I am not filtering out any relevant job postings. I also need to make sure that I am not filtering based on any discriminatory criteria.",
